# FDS BIOS Dumper

This program tests the FDS' ability to switch the nametable arrangement/mirroring via $4025.D3. It also verifies that its state is readable via $4030.D3 (previously undocumented behaviour).

## Usage

Simply load the program into an FDS, whether it be original hardware or on an emulator.

The test results will be shown in the following manner:
- $4025.D3 W: Pass/Fail (nametable arrangement must be switchable) 
- $4030.D3 R: Pass/Fail (nametable arrangement status must be readable)

Original hardware should pass both tests:

## Building

The CC65 toolchain is required to build the program: https://cc65.github.io/
A simple `make` should then work.
